# DSI-Project-2-Regression-Challenge-Ames-Housing-Data-

### Problem Statement

The main objective of this Data Science project - Regression Challenge is to predict the house prices in Ames Lowa.
According to many features provided by this dataset, we need to find the relationship between the sale price with other variables that will have effects to the sale price. Throughout the iterative modeling and features selection processes manually and function built-in (automatically), we will use the predictive modeling as a part of the assessment and evaluation process to gain a deeper insight from 80 variables which were directly related to the property sales

### Conclusion

My first Lasso score from cross validation before tuning is 93.38%, which means 93% of the variance in SalePrice can be explained by the model and also give a pretty good RMSE score. It means that on average the model will predict within $20,299.98 of the actual target. 

After tuning the model by removed some features that have an outsized negative impact on price, like an outlier. 
Now that the offending properties have been removed from the training data, I will split and scale the data again, and then fit a new lasso model to it. This new model should perform better than the original one. 

The model currently has an r2 score of .9138nd an RMSE of 22,420. Additional exploration of the data and feature engineering will likely improve the modelâ€™s performance, particularly with regards to high-value properties. 

As home values near $300,000 the model becomes less reliable. In the absence of this additional research, the model is currently ready for production on homes under $275,000.
